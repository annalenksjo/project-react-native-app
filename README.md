# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This project was made during week 13 of the Technigo Frontend boot camp, and the first project with React Native. 

## The problem
This was my first encounter with React Native, and the project was only one week. I found it difficult to get started with the project since the syntax was so different. My goal with this project was to get a bit familiar with the framework, and not to focus on the design. 

We could choose between a couple of approaches, where I chose to work with navigation, which I thought would be useful. If I had more time I would work more with both the functionality and the design. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
